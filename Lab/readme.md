## Laboratory exercise (remote)

Laboratory work is graded pass/fail and is mandatory to complete the course.

Previously completed laboratory work is valid if there is a record of it in Sisu or Moodle. A previous record may not work correctly with Sisu automation, so please contact Jani if the overall grade does not appear the next day after completing all parts.

Laboratory work is completed remotely using the network simulator GNS3, protocol analyzer Wireshark and an OpenVPN remote connection. 

It is preferred if you can install the software on your computer. We can provide a remote desktop connection (RDP via SSH tunnel) to a virtual machine which has the required software installed upon request.

Remote laboratory exercise can be completed in groups of 1-2 students.  
All group members can work remotely on the same GNS3 project in real time.

Official due date is Thursday, August 31st, at 23:59.

**Report submission / Credit for laboratory exercise**   

1. Follow the instructions and compile a report from the answers in PDF format in English or Finnish

 - Configurations (7 configs) zipped in one archive or include the configurations at the end of the report  
    
4. All group members must submit the report; report must include names of group members

5. Graded pass/fail. Passing mark is a working implementation and about 66% correct answers.  
     - Failed reports can be resubmitted once if submitted before the due date.  
     - Reports are usually checked within 1-2 weeks(Exception: Reports submitted between June 16th and July 31st will be checked in early August).
